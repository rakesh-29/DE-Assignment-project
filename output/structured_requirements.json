After analyzing the natural language requirements, I've structured them into a detailed software specification in JSON format. Here is the output:

```
{
  "Project Overview": {
    "Project Name": "Simple Calculator App",
    "Project Description": "A basic calculator application that performs arithmetic operations",
    "Version": "1.0"
  },

  "Functional Requirements": {
    "Calculator Feature": {
      "Description": "Perform arithmetic operations",
      "Components": {
        "Number Input": {
          "Description": "Allow users to input numbers",
          "Requirements": [
            "Accept numeric input",
            "Display input values"
          ]
        },
        "Operator Selection": {
          "Description": "Allow users to select arithmetic operators",
          "Requirements": [
            "Provide options for basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)",
            "Display selected operator"
          ]
        },
        "Calculation": {
          "Description": "Perform calculations based on user input",
          "Requirements": [
            "Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division",
            "Display calculation result"
          ]
        },
        "Clear Function": {
          "Description": "Clear calculator input and result",
          "Requirements": [
            "Clear input fields",
            "Reset calculation result"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },

  "Non-Functional Requirements": {
    "Performance": {
      "Description": "Ensure responsive calculator functionality",
      "Requirements": [
        "Respond to user input within 100ms",
        "Perform calculations within 50ms"
      ]
    },
    "Usability": {
      "Description": "Provide an intuitive user interface",
      "Requirements": [
        "Use clear and concise labeling",
        "Ensure button sizes and spacing are accessible"
      ]
    },
    "Error Handling": {
      "Description": "Handle invalid user input and calculation errors",
      "Requirements": [
        "Display error messages for invalid input",
        "Handle division by zero errors"
      ]
    }
  },

  "Technical Constraints": {
    "Platform": "Web application",
    "Programming Language": "JavaScript",
    "Frontend Framework": "React"
  },

  "API Specifications": {
    "None": "No API integrations required for this application"
  },

  "Data Models": {
    "Calculator State": {
      "Attributes": [
        "inputValue1",
        "inputValue2",
        "operator",
        "result"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each section:

* **Project Overview**: Provides a brief summary of the project, including its name, description, and version.
* **Functional Requirements**: Breaks down the calculator feature into its components, including number input, operator selection, calculation, and clear function. Each component has a description and a list of specific requirements.
* **Non-Functional Requirements**: Defines performance, usability, and error handling requirements that are essential for the application's overall quality.
* **Technical Constraints**: Specifies the platform, programming language, and frontend framework to be used for the application.
* **API Specifications**: Since this application doesn't require any API integrations, this section is empty.
* **Data Models**: Defines the calculator state data model, which includes attributes for input values, the operator, and the result.

This structured specification provides a clear and actionable guide for the coding team to develop a simple calculator app that meets the required functionality, performance, and usability standards.
